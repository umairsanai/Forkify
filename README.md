# üç¥ Forkify: Cook Your Way

Forkify is a dynamic web application that allows you to search, create, and manage your favorite recipes. It provides an interactive interface for discovering new dishes, adjusting serving sizes on the fly, and bookmarking recipes for later.

All your custom recipes and bookmarks are saved directly in your browser using `localStorage`, so your data persists even after you close the tab.

* **Add Your Own Recipes:** Create and add your own custom recipes. These are stored locally and are visible only to you.
* **Dynamic Servings:** Easily adjust the number of servings for any recipe, and the ingredient quantities will update automatically.
* **Bookmarks:** Save your favorite recipes to a bookmarks list for quick access.
* **Persistent Storage:** Your bookmarks and custom-added recipes are saved using `localStorage`, ensuring they are not lost when you close the browser.
